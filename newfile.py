# Problem
# 1. Prompts the user for a level an iteger between 1-3, (done)
# If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program should prompt again. (done)
# 2. using the user's input, generate 10 math problmes that only supports the addition opration. (+)
# 3. Prompts the user to solve each of those problems.
# If an answer is not correct (or not even a number), the program should output EEE and prompt the user again,
# allowing the user up to three tries in total for that problem. If the user has still not answered
# correctly after three tries, the program should output the correct answer.
# The program should ultimately output the userâ€™s score: the number of correct answers out of 10.

# My Solution
